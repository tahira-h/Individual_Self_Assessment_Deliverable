### Individual_Self_Assessment_Deliverable

# Self Assessment:

The main role that I played over the course of the project was the X role. However, Kaitlin and I switched every other week between the X role and Triangle role to make sure that we both did a fair amount of work. 

If I did not take on a role, such as a square or circle, I would ask my team mate if they needed any assistance on their weekly task. And If I did not have the answer, I would meet with a T.A. during office hours to ask the question. 

My greatest personal challenge over the course of this project was communication with my teammates. I am used to doing projects and work on my own, however, I had to remember that there are three other individuals in my team who are graded as fairly as I am. The way I overcame my challenge with communication was ask my teammates what ideas do they have, and if I did come up with an idea, I made sure I had approval from everyone and made sure there was an understanding of what I was doing so no one was lost about what it is that I was doing. I also asked my teammates to reiterate what they were doing and their goal with the information they were presenting to make sure I was understanding what they were doing as well, so no one was lost in the process of completing the project. 

# Team Assessment: 

Overall, the team was great and communication was well provided in our slack channel. A challenge that we had was our weekly schedule, to resolve this issue was slack each other whenever we submitted something to GitHub, and we asked each other questions when needed. I do not know what my team would want to do differently as a whole. 

Strengths we had as a team was wanting to get work done in advance so we set a time limit each week to make sure our work was done in advance, and to not leave anyone behind. We also made sure everyone agreed on our next steps with a clear understanding before proceeding with any new steps taken in our project. I will give Kaitlin, Merin, and Chloe Belle a thumbs up and a score of 10/10 of teamwork during this project.

# Summary of Project: 

Topic was wildfires, the machine module mostly used was supervised machine learning, and K-meaning algorithms. Results of the analysis showed that county, precipitation, and temperature reported in our data was 62% accurate with predicting wildfires each year. There was some data not found in our data when searching for precipitation, temperatures, and counties.
